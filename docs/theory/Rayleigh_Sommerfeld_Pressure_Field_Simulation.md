**Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of Acoustic Fields in 1-D and 2-D Piston Elements Using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral**

### 1. Introduction
Ultrasonic phased arrays rely on the precise modeling of acoustic wave propagation to optimize beam steering and focusing. One of the most accurate models for evaluating the pressure field of a single transducer element is the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral (RS integral). This integral provides a fundamental solution for predicting wave behavior from a piston source embedded in a rigid baffle. The present study validates numerical simulations of the acoustic field generated by 1-D and 2-D piston elements using the RS integral. The results are supported by theoretical formulations found in *Fundamentals of Ultrasonic Phased Arrays* by Lester W. Schmerr Jr.

### 2. The Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral and Piston Element Models
The Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral is a boundary integral formulation that provides the pressure field at any observation point based on the contributions from a finite-sized aperture. This approach assumes a monochromatic wave propagating through an isotropic medium, making it particularly well-suited for modeling phased array elements (Schmerr, 2015, Chapter 2). The RS integral is expressed as:

$$
    p(x, z) = \frac{i \rho c}{2\pi} \int_S \frac{e^{ikR}}{R} dS
$$

where:
- $p(x, z)$ is the pressure at point $(x, z)$,
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $c$ is the wave propagation speed,
- $k$ is the wave number $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$,
- $R$ is the distance between the source and observation point,
- $S$ is the surface of the piston element.

This formulation is numerically approximated using discretization techniques, as described in **Chapter 2 (Acoustic Field of a 1-D Array Element)** and **Appendix C.1 (Beam Models for Single Elements)** of Schmerr’s work.

### 3. Computational Procedure for Generating the Figures

The pressure field visualizations presented in this study were generated using a numerical implementation of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral. The computational model is executed using the following commands from the repository's root directory:

#### **Generation of the 1-D Piston Element Pressure Field**

The **1-D normalized pressure field** was computed using:
```sh
python ../../src/interface/rs_2Dv_interface.py --b 6.35/2 --f 5 --c 1500 --e 0 --x 0 --z '5,230,15000' --plot-mode 1D
```
This command produces the **Figure 1** output and uses the following parameters:
- **`--b 6.35/2`**: Half-length of the piston element (3.175 mm)
- **`--f 5`**: Frequency of 5 MHz
- **`--c 1500`**: Propagation speed of 1500 m/s
- **`--e 0`**: No lateral offset
- **`--x 0`**: X-coordinate for evaluation
- **`--z '5,230,15000'`**: Z-coordinates spanning from 5 mm to 230 mm, with 15000 points
- **`--plot-mode 1D`**: Output a 1-Dimensional pressure field

#### **Generation of the 2-D Piston Element Pressure Field**

The **2-D normalized pressure field** was computed using:
```sh
python ../../src/interface/rs_2Dv_interface.py --b 1.0 --f 5 --c 1500 --e 0 --x2="-10,10,700" --z2="1,22,700" --plot-mode 2D
```
This command produces the **Figure 2** output and uses the following parameters:
- **`--b 1.0`**: Element width of 1.0 mm
- **`--f 5`**: Frequency of 5 MHz
- **`--c 1500`**: Propagation speed of 1500 m/s
- **`--e 0`**: No lateral offset
- **`--x2="-10,10,700"`**: X-coordinates spanning from -10 mm to 10 mm, with 700 points
- **`--z2="1,22,700"`**: Z-coordinates spanning from 1 mm to 22 mm, with 700 points
- **`--plot-mode 2D`**: Output a 2-Dimensional pressure field

This ensures **reproducibility** and makes the numerical procedures clear for other researchers.

### 6. Conclusion
The presented figures align closely with theoretical predictions based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral. The 1-D analysis highlights **near-field oscillations and far-field decay**, while the 2-D analysis confirms **beam focusing and side lobe formation**. These results provide strong validation for phased array beam modeling techniques discussed in Chapters 2, 4, and Appendix C of Schmerr’s *Fundamentals of Ultrasonic Phased Arrays*. This work reinforces the importance of **numerical modeling for practical phased array transducer design**.
